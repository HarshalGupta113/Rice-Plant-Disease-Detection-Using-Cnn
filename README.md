# Rice-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Cnn

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying diseases in rice plants. The model analyzes leaf patterns and identifies diseases, such as bacterial leaf blight, by leveraging image processing techniques.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/rice-leaf-diseases?resource=download).

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data augmentation and preprocessing to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Model Implementation:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effective image classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation of the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** Provides visual insights into the model's predictions and decision-making process.
