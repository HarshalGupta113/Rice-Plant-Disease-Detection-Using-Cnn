# Rice-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Cnn

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying diseases in rice plants. The model analyzes leaf patterns and identifies diseases, such as bacterial leaf blight, by leveraging image processing techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data augmentation and preprocessing to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Model Implementation:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effective image classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation of the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** Provides visual insights into the model's predictions and decision-making process.

## Use Case
This project is particularly useful in the agricultural domain, where early detection of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop health and preventing losses. The developed model can serve as a valuable tool for researchers and farmers alike.
